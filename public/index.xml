    <description> My daily goals from yesterday were too ambitious and I didn’t complete all of them. I will start my day with a 5k morning run today and set more realistic goals and focus on completing one task for each category.</description>

    <description>Today is May 2nd, 2024, and we have eight months left in the year. I think it’s more realistic to split our goals into two parts, each spanning 4 months, or a quarter.</description>
