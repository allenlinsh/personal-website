title: Daily goals
---

Starting today, I want to document my journey to making my first million dollars. I will set goals each day before I go to bed, follow through the next day when I wake up, and repeat the process until I reach my goal.

In order to achieve my goals, I have to be very intentional about how I spend my time, what I do, and the people I surround myself with.

Every night, I will evaluate whether I've achieved my daily goals or not, and set new goals for the next day. If I don't complete my goals, I will have to start my day with a 5k morning run the next morning.
