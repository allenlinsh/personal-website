### Notes

**11:47 PM**: Today I'm gonna start an experiment where I don't listen to music for a month. I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3gwLK5ZVgE) last night about how music is a form of escapism if you have music addiction. The conclusion is that music intensifies or numbs emotion and if you listen to music compulsively youâ€™re subconsciously using it to escape reality. The rule that I set for myself is that I'm still allowed to listen to any kind of nature sounds, but I'm not allowed to play music if it's a compulsive behavior where the music doesn't naturally exist, such as when I'm riding a bike, studying, walking outside (especially if I'm in nature). I need to learn to be more content with silence and be more intentional about music so that I can appreciate it more when I listen to it. We're consistently being bombarded with entertainment in our lives that they're inseparable, which fits pretty well with the definition of an addiction. I'll conclude my results in one month and see whether I would like to continue with this experiment or not.

**7:00 PM**: I did the 222 survey today and here are the [results](https://welcome.222.place/?id=SDkAllen%20Lindf1211%2F06%2F200134ABostonjw&p=%2B1%20805%20886%207848). It shows that I'm an "experimentalist".
