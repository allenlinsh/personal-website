title: Goals
---

Starting today, I want to document (build in public) my journey to making my first million dollars. I will set goals each day before I go to bed, follow through the next day when I wake up, and repeat the process until I reach $1M.

In order to achieve my goals, I have to be very intentional about how I spend my time, what I do, and the people I surround myself with.

Every night, I will evaluate whether I've achieved my daily goals or not, and set new goals for the next day.
