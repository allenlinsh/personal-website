### Reflection

Today feels very different from the last couple of days. After doing a 5-minute meditation this morning, I feel more self-aware of my surroundings and of the things I say and do. It almost feels like what I was doing before was on autopilot, and now I'm more present. For example, it almost feels like all the startup & builder stuff that I was doing was just a distraction from what I really wanted to do, which is to create value in this world. By being more intentional about my actions and how my time is spent, I feel like I'm listening to myself more and doing things that I genuinely find interesting and valuable. "Working hard for something we don't care about is called stress; working hard for something we love is called passion." I want to find my true passion, and the first step is to be true to myself and listen to myself.
