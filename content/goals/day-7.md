- [x] Discuss with Nick about Next Steps

### Backlog

### Notes

I think I should allocate either Monday as the planning day to scope out the tasks for the week. The first Monday of each month will be the day for high-level planning to scope out the OKRs for the month and to reflect on the past month of progress.
