### Challenge of the day

- [ ] Set up Github Project for Fireplace and migrate away from Jira

### Tasks

- [ ] Discuss with Nick about Next Steps
- [ ] Meet with Shrey about rev and v1. Learn about their approach, the tools they use, how they keep track of member engagement, and share ideas for rev capsule
- [ ] Complete two tickets for Fireplace

### Backlog

- [ ] Reach out to Vivian, Sejin, and KP about marketing

### Notes

I think I should allocate either Monday as the planning day to scope out the tasks for the week. The first Monday of each month will be the day for high-level planning to scope out the OKRs for the month and to reflect on the past month of progress.
