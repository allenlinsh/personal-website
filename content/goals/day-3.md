### Notes

**1:50 PM**: Yesterday I spent too much time on the hold-to-record feature for Wakeup Club, and didn't spend enough time doing other tasks. I didn't go to the gym, and I didn't record a new episode of Morning Walk & Talk. I also got bored and downloaded a Netflix game on my phone, and ended up playing it for multiple hours instead of going to bed on time.

Today I woke up at 8:30 AM and I didn't start my day until 10:30 AM because I was playing video games. I didn't write a reflection last night, and I went to bed feeling like I didn't do much yesterday. I don't know why I'm wasting my time and I need to stop. I have a paper on my wall that says "Discipline" and I hand-wrote my morning routine on that paper, but I'm not following it. When I saw it this morning, I just ignored it.

I think my morning routine is messed up because my lizard brain is getting dopamine from video games. To fix this, I need to practice doing things even if I don't feel like it. I already missed two days of Morning Walk & Talk and gym. I need to get back on track and do them today. The game is making me feel like I accomplished something, but in reality the game is just a game, and I'm not doing anything to help myself reach my goals. I have to simply uninstall that game and even delete my game data just so that I won't want to restart the game. If there's any value to the game it would be the achievement systems and I can copy the design for Wakeup Club. I am going to delete the game now.

I just deleted the game, and I'm gonna try to timeblock my day by setting a bunch of alarms to remind myself that I have to move on to the next task no matter what I'm doing - no more procrastination.

**2:16 PM**: I got distracted and started implementing features for Wakeup Club instead of doing the tasks I set for on my calendar. I need to stop doing this and focus on the tasks I set for myself, especially when it comes to bed time.

**2:58 PM**: I just pushed a new build to Testflight, then I got myself distracted working on the onboarding recording screen even though I don't need to do that right now. I need to have better control over my brain.

**3:04 PM**: My brain is not functioning well today and I keep daydreaming whenever I started debugging the code. I need to cut down on the number of tasks today and make sure that I complete every task.

**3:42 PM**: I literally just wasted another hour scrolling on Instagram. I'm going to delete all of my social media apps now. If I need to post something, I can use the web version. I also need to put away my phone and actually go do the things that I told myself to. From now on, I will rely on my laptop for any Internet access. My phone will only be used for calls, messages, and app development.

**5:34 PM**: I just woke up from a one-hour nap because I couldn't get myself to do anything. Then I realized what the problem was: I didn't eat anything today and my blood sugar was low. I'm gonna go make something to eat.

**12:39AM**: I need to work on doing hard things, improving communication skills, and focusing on nutrition. In the morning, I will plan to create a storyboard for Jiu-Jitsu Club. And before bed, I will draft a script for the new Morning Walk & Talk video, read, and journal more. I also need to follow the discipline chart more strictly.
