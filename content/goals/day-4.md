### Notes

**11:21 AM**: I woke up at around 9 AM today and had a good start. However, I didn't do my morning walk, didn't eat breakfast, and I ended up spending too much time tinkering with [Athena](https://alnln.com) - my personal voice notes AI. I was also supposed to discuss the Europe trip with Luden but now it's been delayed. I'm going to wrap up the deployment for Athena and head out as soon as possible.
