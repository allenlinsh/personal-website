### Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it

Here's my daily routine:

_Morning_

- `7:00 AM`: Wake up, get out of bed, drink a glass of water, and walk straight into cold shower.
- `7:05 AM`: Brush my teeth, make my bed, and meditate for 5 minutes.
- `7:10 AM`: On a paper notebook, write down:
  - What I'm grateful for
  - What I want to achieve today
  - What I'm going to do to achieve it
- `7:15 AM`: Go for a morning walk or run under direct sunlight for 15 minutes.
- `7:45 AM`: Take a shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and drink coffee.
- `8:00 AM`: Start working on the most mentally challenging task for the day.

_Afternoon_

- `12:00 PM`: Eat lunch and take supplements.
  - Fish oil
  - Vitamin D3

_Evening_

Some non-negotiable hard rules:

- No social media.
- No meetings before 12:00 PM.
- No scrolling on social media at any given time.
  - It is a tool for making money, not for entertainment.
